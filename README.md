**Introduction**

This repository contains the code for our project: **Optimized Prompting in SAM for Few-Shot and Weakly Supervised Segmentation of Complex Structures and Small Lesions**. In this project, we fine-tune the decoder part of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) using the Vanilla method, where all parameters are updated during training, as depicted in Figure 1.
