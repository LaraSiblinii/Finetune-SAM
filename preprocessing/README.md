**Overview**
The *'dataset.py'* file provides a template for setting up a dataset in your project. It includes transformations and preprocessing steps
tailored to your data. This README explains how to customize the *'dataset.py'* file for different datasets, with a particular focus on the
*'ScaleIntensityRanged'* transform and handling of *'prompts'*.

**Note:** The SAMDataset function is defined in *'main.py'*. This README focuses on explaining how to modify *'dataset.py'* but does not 
require running this file directly during training.

**Key Transformations:**
**1. 'ScaleIntensityRanged'**
The *'ScaleIntensityRanged'* transform is used to scale the intensity values of your images and labels. This normalization ensures that the input
data is consistent and suitable for model training. Hereâ€™s how to configure it based on your dataset:
**For Images:**
